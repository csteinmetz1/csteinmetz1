### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I am an AI researcher passionate about leveraging machine learning for audio signal processing.** 

I am the developer a number of audio and ML packages, such as [dasp](https://github.com/csteinmetz1/dasp-pytorch) which implements our research in differentiable signal processing, [auraloss](https://github.com/csteinmetz1/auraloss) for audio-focused loss functions, as well as [pyloudnorm](https://github.com/csteinmetz1/pyloudnorm) for simple measurement of perceptual loudness, and [pymixconsole](https://github.com/csteinmetz1/pymixconsole) a headless DAW in Python.

See [my website](https://www.christiansteinmetz.com/) for more details, and please [reach out](mailto:c.j.steinmetz@qmul.ac.uk) if you have any questions, or just would like to chat about audio and ML.
