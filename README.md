### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I am working on designing machine learning systems for advancing audio engineering.** 

I have also built a number of audio packages, such as [auraloss](https://github.com/csteinmetz1/auraloss) for audio-focused loss functions, as well as [pyloudnorm]() for simple measurement of perceptual loudness, and [pymixconsole](https://github.com/csteinmetz1/pymixconsole) a headless DAW in Python.

See [my website](https://www.christiansteinmetz.com/) for more details, and please [reach out](mailto:c.j.steinmetz@qmul.ac.uk) if you have any questions, or just would like to chat about audio and ML.
